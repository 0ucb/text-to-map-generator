### In Progress ðŸ”„
- **Testing coverage** - Test suite implementation for core functionality
- **Performance optimization** - Bundle analysis and optimization opportunities
- **Documentation updates** - Ensuring all new features are documented

## Known Issues & Technical Debt

### Minor Issues
- **Testing suite incomplete** - Core functionality tests need implementation
- **Bundle optimization** - Potential for further code splitting
- **Type coverage** - Some components could benefit from TypeScript conversion

### Performance Considerations
- **Large map handling** - Optimization needed for maps with 100+ elements
- **AI response caching** - Reduce redundant API calls for similar requests
- **SVG rendering** - Potential virtualization for very large datasets

## Next Priority Items

### Immediate (High Priority)
1. **Implement comprehensive test suite** - Unit and integration tests for core functionality
2. **Performance audit** - Bundle analysis and optimization
3. **Error logging** - Enhanced error tracking and user feedback

### Short-term (Medium Priority)
1. **Advanced AI features** - Template suggestions, style recommendations
2. **Export enhancements** - PNG/SVG export, higher resolution options
3. **Accessibility improvements** - Enhanced keyboard navigation and screen reader support

### Long-term (Low Priority)
1. **Collaborative features** - Real-time multi-user editing
2. **Advanced styling** - Custom themes, presentation modes
3. **Integration APIs** - Embed capabilities for other applications

## Development Environment Status

### Build System Health
- **Development server** - Fast HMR with Vite 6.0
- **Production builds** - Optimized with manual chunk splitting
- **Linting** - Clean ESLint 9 configuration with no warnings
- **Type checking** - TypeScript 5.7 configured and functional

### Dependency Status
