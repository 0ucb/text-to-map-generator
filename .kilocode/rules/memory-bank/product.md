# Product Definition

## Core Purpose

The Text-to-Map Generator bridges the gap between natural language description and visual spatial representation. It solves the challenge of quickly creating interactive maps from textual descriptions without requiring design skills or complex mapping software.

## Problems It Solves

### Primary Pain Points
- Manual map creation is time-consuming and requires technical expertise
- Difficulty translating written descriptions into visual spatial layouts
- Need for rapid prototyping of geographic or spatial concepts
- Lack of intuitive tools for collaborative map creation and iteration

### Target Users
- **Content Creators**: Authors, game designers, screenwriters needing to visualize fictional worlds
- **Educators**: Teachers creating visual aids for geography, history, or storytelling
- **Project Managers**: Creating spatial workflows, site plans, or process maps
- **Researchers**: Anthropologists, historians, or urban planners mapping relationships

## How It Should Work

### Core User Journey
1. **Input**: Users describe spatial relationships in natural language
2. **Processing**: System parses text and generates map coordinates instantly
3. **Visualization**: Interactive SVG map renders with immediate feedback
4. **Refinement**: Users manually adjust, add details, or request AI assistance
5. **Enhancement**: AI provides contextual suggestions and optimizations
6. **Export**: Save or share the completed map in multiple formats

### Natural Language Interface
The application processes diverse linguistic patterns:
- Directional relationships: "Castle is 5 miles north of Village"
- Proximity descriptions: "Market is nearby the Church"
- Complex positioning: "Well is between Market and Tavern"
- Named connections: "The road between A and B is Main Street"
- Feature naming and renaming capabilities

## User Experience Goals

### Primary Success Metrics
- **Speed**: Create basic maps in under 2 minutes
- **Accuracy**: 90%+ successful parsing of spatial descriptions
- **Accessibility**: No technical skills required - uses natural language
- **Iteration**: Real-time editing and refinement capabilities
- **Intelligence**: AI assistance enhances rather than replaces user creativity

### Value Proposition
- **Time Savings**: Reduces map creation from hours to minutes
- **Learning Curve**: New users productive within first session
- **Creative Flow**: Ideas flow directly from description to visualization
- **Collaboration**: Natural language enables non-technical participation
- **Export Flexibility**: Supports various workflow integration needs
